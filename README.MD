# Dog Image Classifier

The objective of this project is to classify pet images using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and evaluate its performance in identifying dogs and distinguishing dog breeds. The system processes images from a specified directory, compares the classified labels generated by the CNN model to the true labels derived from the image filenames, and assesses the model's accuracy. It supports multiple CNN architectures, including VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet, to determine which model performs best. Additionally, the program calculates statistics on classification results, such as accuracy in identifying dogs and dog breeds, while providing detailed insights into classification errors.
